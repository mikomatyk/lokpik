# LOK PiK

This is the relic source code of the *LOK PiK* sport shooting club website and
documents. I managed the club and ran its website from the year 2020 to 2022. I
keep it here as a legacy of that experience, though I've since stepped away from
my role and today I'm not involved in the club anymore. The original website is
no longer active, and the domain *lokpik.org* is no longer under my control.
